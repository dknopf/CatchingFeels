# CatchingFeels
The executable file for Catching Feels, a game made over the course of 48 hours by a team of five first time Unity users during a hackathon

In Catching Feels you play as Cupid, attempting to match couples up by shooting them with love's arrows! In arcade mode you have 60 seconds to match together as many couples (indicated by them having the same outfit) as you can! In endless mode you have an unlimited amount of time to explore the scenery, while also having the added goal of matching together the two NPCs who are centered in the two camera views in the bottom left of the screen.

Move using WASD, shoot using left click, and quit using Escape!
